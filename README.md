# TalkSense

TalkSense is a continuous speech monitoring and interpretation service that captures spoken conversations, deciphers the content, and sends the interpreted text to a router service. It's designed to provide insights from verbal interactions and enable the transformation of speech into meaningful data.

## Features

- **Continuous Monitoring**: TalkSense works tirelessly in the background, continuously listening to ongoing conversations.

- **Speech Deciphering**: The service extracts spoken words from the audio and converts them into text, effectively translating verbal communication into written content.

- **Interpretation**: TalkSense goes beyond mere transcription. It interprets the context and meaning behind the spoken words, offering a deeper understanding of the conversations.

- **Router Service Integration**: The deciphered text is seamlessly sent to a router service for further processing. This allows you to route, store, analyze, or integrate the interpreted content as needed.
